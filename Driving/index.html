                        <P>1<u>Application Process for a Driving License:</u><br> To get a driving license in India, an applicant can either apply online or can visit the nearest RTO office. These are the two ways through which one can proceed to get their
                            driving license.<br>
                            <u>The Online Process:</u><br> • The applicant needs to check the official portal of Sarathi and download Form 4.<br> • As per the given instructions, the form needs to be filled up and submitted.<br> • The forms need to be
                            printed out, and Part D is to be only filled by the parents or the guardian in case the applicant is a minor.<br> • The form needs to be uploaded with all other required documents.<br> • A web application number will be generated
                            for reference to track the application status.<br> • Once the entire application process is finished, a notification will be sent by SMS.<br>
                            <u>The Offline Process:</u><br> • The applicant can download Form 4 from the Sarathi portal or collect the form from the nearby RTO Office.<br> • Form 4 should be filled up appropriately and should be submitted along with other
                            required documents.<br> • The applicant can also schedule a slot in the RTO office for the driving license test.<br> The applicant needs to attend the driving license test based on the specific date and time allotted to them.
                            After qualifying for the examination, the candidate will receive the driving license on the spot or through a post on their registered address. Despite having such a straightforward process, the percentage of applicants appearing
                            for the driving test is as low as 41%.<br>
                            <u>Final Words:</u><br> A driving license is an essential legal document that gives the permit to a driver to ride lawfully on the roads. It can be easily seen that the Government of India took the initiative to amend the Motors
                            Vehicles Act of 1988. This step led to a 10% fall in the rate of accidents all over the country.<br> With the public conveyance becoming more stressful to ride on the roads, commuters can quickly get access to a driving license.
                            It grants the freedom to drive the vehicle as per the requirement of the rider. In addition to all the factors, a driving license is a widely accepted form of personal identification proof that can be used in various government
                            offices and agencies.
                        </P>
                        <p><u>Eligibility for different driving licenses in India:</u><br> The eligibility criteria for a driving license in India are mainly dependent on two factors, the type of vehicle and the type of driving license one has. The details
                            of the eligibility criteria are further furnished below. General eligibility<br> The applicant needs to have familiarity with the traffic rules of the country. Documents related to age proof and address proof need to be submitted
