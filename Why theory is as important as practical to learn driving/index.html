                    <P>A good driving school will make sure that the participants are equipped to handle emergencies, use first aid, react correctly for situations emerging on roads like road rage incidents, aware of the symbols lighting up on the car’s
                        instrument cluster, and honouring the rights of others on the road.<br> <br>-Learning how to drive can be a very exciting time for young people, but it can also be a very stressful experience. Trying to learn a new skill can be
                        tough, but driving is a skill that’s a major responsibility. And for new drivers who fully understand the level of responsibility that driving involves can feel nervous about getting behind the wheel while they gain the experience
                        they need to become licensed drivers. If this sounds familiar to you, or sounds like a teen driver you know, try these tips to help you build your confidence while staying safe on the road. <br><br>-Get Comfortable Before Driving
                        Before you start driving anywhere, it’s very important to make sure your car is properly adjusted. Mirror adjustment is very important for making sure that you’re able to clearly see behind you and in neighbouring lanes. But don’t
                        forget to be sure that your seat and steering wheel are adjusted to be as comfortable as possible. If you start driving and realize your seat is uncomfortable, it can be very distracting and take your focus away from the road.
                        Ditch the Distractions When people think of distracted driving, they often think of texting while driving. But distracted driving can occur in many different ways, such as eating while driving, having conversations, or adjusting
                        your GPS. If there’s something that might take your mind and/or eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel, try to eliminate those distractions before you start moving. <br><br>If you need GPS for your trip, make sure it’s all
                        set before heading out of the driveway. If you tend to look at your phone a lot, make sure it’s set on silent so that you don’t get distracted by the sound of notifications. Better yet, keeping your phone in a bag or in the glove
                        compartment can help reduce the temptation to check your phone. Practice During Low Traffic Times When you’re just starting to learn how to drive, busy traffic can feel very intimidating and stressful. As you try to build your
                        confidence behind the wheel, try practicing at times when there aren’t a lot of other cars on the road.<br> <br>That way, you have a chance to get used to the feel of your car and build your skills without worrying as much about
                        other people. Practice in Familiar Areas Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves getting stressed out over something unexpected on the road, like an unexpected lane closure. While it might be tempting to go out and
                        explore while you practice your driving skills, it can be a good idea to initially stick to areas you’re familiar with so that you have a general idea of what the conditions are like so that you don’t suddenly encounter something
                        stressful. Maintain Good Following Distance Proper following distance is an extremely important way to prevent car accidents. If there’s something ahead of you in the road, you need to be able to have enough time to be able to
                        safely react to it. </P>
