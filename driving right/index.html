                To begin with, let us look at the state of driving in India. Every year, around 1 50 000 people die due to road accidents, which is more than the number of people who have died in all the wars put together that India has fought. In comparison, the United States of America which is a developed auto market witnessed 40 000 road accident deaths in 2016. Out of 1 50 000 road accident fatalities, more than 25 000 deaths were due to car crashes. This is primarily because of negligent driving. More accidents are occurring due to wrong behavior than a lack of skills. Hence, controlling one’s behavior is as important a part of driving training as attaining driving skills

                   </b>
                   <p class="para2"><br> 
                    Everyone on the road enjoys driving as much as you do. Roads are public property and it is extremely important that you drive safely. It is necessary to adhere to the traffic rules and maintain a safe distance between your car and other vehicles. Drive very carefully near schools, hospitals, and construction zones. Strictly adhere to the driving rules when you are near children, blind persons, handicapped individuals, and old people. Safe driving habits can reduce fuel consumption, decrease emissions, and reduce travel time too. Our collective behavior forms our road culture.

                <b>SPEED IS NOT ALWAYS FUN</b>
                <p class="para2"><br>
                    Driving conditions and traffic flow are factors that dictate your driving speed. While staying within the speed limit, you also need to match your driving speed with the traffic flow. The chances of crashing into vehicles in front of you increase if you drive faster than the traffic flow. Maintaining a steady speed, within legal limits, at a safe following distance will help give you the time required to handle an emergency situation. Constantly anticipating what may emerge on the road makes you a safe and responsible driver.

                        We love our technologically advanced cars and various driving assists that they come with, but with the advent of these technologies, drivers are becoming negligent too. At times, these tools divert the attention and lead to unsafe driving. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the road at all times and abide by the rules and regulations while driving. Never text while driving as it can endanger your life along with the lives of your co-passengers.

                    You must always practice everything that you learned for your four wheeler driving test. As it turns out, most of those rules aren’t just good driving lessons; they are legal regulations. It is better to follow traffic lights than get into an episode of road-rage. Make sure you are not talking on the phone while driving. And last but not least, never drive after consuming alcohol

                <p class="para2"><br>
                    It helps a great deal to understand the features of your car. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, a budding driver should understand the working of various systems of the vehicle so that the driver is able to take the correct decision in case of any abnormality observed or emergency situation faced. Exploring your own car is a sure-shot way to a happier driving experience. Learn to listen to your car and ensure that you have complete knowledge of all the controls and their functions. You will realize that a lot of this technical knowledge is not all that difficult to master.

                    Do a thorough safety check before starting a journey. Keep the checklist of the most important things ready, like seatbelts, mirrors, fuel, water, air pressure, first aid kit, spare tires, toolbox, spare bulbs and fuses, and an emergency parking reflector. Use the mirrors and signaling indicators to not only ensure your own safety but also the safety of other vehicles.
