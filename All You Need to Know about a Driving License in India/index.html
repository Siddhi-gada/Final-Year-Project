                <div class="main-content-description">
                    Broadly speaking, there are four types of driving licenses – learner’s, permanent, commercial and international.
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-title">
                    <strong>1. Learner’s Driving License</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    The first of these has a short validity of just six months, while the latter can be used for as many as 20 years. Also, one can apply for a permanent license only after the completion of one month since the issuance of the learner’s license. Also, a learner’s
                    license can be received simply by completing a few formalities at the local RTO but the permanent version isn’t issued right away.
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-title">
                    <strong>2. Permanent Driving License</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    So, basically, anyone who wants to drive a motor vehicle on public roads and is wondering how to apply for a driving license needs to first obtain a learner’s license from the local RTO. The same is issued for a period of 6 months, wherein the holder
                    can learn to use a vehicle. Before the expiry of the document, the holder needs to visit the RTO and give an exam. A permanent license is issued if the person is able to pass both theoretical and practical tests.
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-title">
                    <strong>3. Commercial Driving License</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    Now, this is a special category of driving license that is issued to those who need to drive commercial vehicles of any of these three categories – Heavy Motor Vehicles, Medium Motor Vehicles and Light Goods Transport Motor Vehicles. The eligibility criteria
                    to obtain a commercial driving license is different from that of the above two categories. However, the process of applying for it is the same as the Permanent Driving License
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-title">
                    <strong>4. International Driving Permit</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    As the name suggests, this is a permit that is required for Indian driving license holders wishing to drive in a foreign land. The RTO provides this permit as a certification of one’s eligibility to drive in a foreign land. This permit comes printed in
                    various languages to help authorities make note of the holder’s eligibility to drive in a given country. In order to obtain this permit, one is required to have a valid permanent driving license and submit an application in a local
                    RTO. The international driving permit has a validity of only one year.
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-title">
                    <strong>Follow the road rules</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    When the number of vehicles is less on the road, it is quite easy to drive. But when the numbers go high, you need to be careful to follow the rules. Follow the signals at all time. Sometimes your hand signals convey the other drivers about your intentions
                    like slow down, turn and allowing of overtaking.

                            For Premium, you start and end your training in your registered branch using the training vehicle of your choice. For the Executive Course, you can be picked-up and dropped-off to and from your location of choice. For the Rush Course, it is 5-8 hours
                            of straight driving.
