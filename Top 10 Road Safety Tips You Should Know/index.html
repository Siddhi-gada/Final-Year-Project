                <div class="p"><br>
                    <br>
                    <p><u>1. MAKE SURE THE VEHICLE IS FIT FOR THE TRIP</u><br> Most of the driving safety tips below are going to be about following common sense and driving as safely as possible. However, the condition of your car itself plays a contributing
                        role to your safety on the road, so we can’t ignore that. A long drive or a road trip aren’t like any other drive. They’re much more demanding. As such, you might push your car to its limits in terms of performance.
                        <br> Ensure that your vehicle is ready for the trip.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>2. AVOID SLEEPINESS ON THE ROAD</u><br> Drowsy driving is a serious risk.<br> Driving while fighting sleep can put you in as much danger as driving under the influence, yet it’s not a risk that’s talked about as often. With longer
                        drives, such a road trips, drowsy driving is even more of a danger.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>3. ENSURE THERE ARE NO DISTRACTIONS</u><br> Not having your focus on the road is one of the greatest risks while driving and the reason this is on of our top road safety tips. <br> Keep your attention 100% on the road at all times.
                        Trying to multitask can put you in severe danger. Road trips and long drives are often made in groups. If you have people in the car with you, then lay some ground rules before you set off. <br> Talking can be just fine, but if
                        there is any shouting, jostling, or otherwise distracting activity in the car, be ready to stop the car at the earliest convenience and cut it out.<br> Others in the car can help you avoid distraction, too. <br> For instance, someone
                        can be in charge of the map, another in charge of the music. You want to avoid taking your hands from the wheel and gearstick as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>4. BRING AN EMERGENCY KIT WITH YOU</u><br> Even if you’re driving as safely as possible, it’s always wise to be prepared for the event of something going wrong. This is a severely underrated road safety tip. <br> First of all, a
                        subscription to any roadside assistance plan is critical when going on longer drives. After all, you can end up out in the middle of nowhere and find yourself needing help.</p>
                    <p><u>5. ALWAYS OBEY THE SPEED LIMIT</u><br> It might sound like common sense to some. To others it might sound like one of our road safety tips you don’t always necessarily need to follow.<br> Many drivers think that pushing over the
                        speed limit a little is perfectly acceptable to shave a few minutes off the length of the journey.<br> Speeding, even when it seems relatively safe, is always a danger.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>6. PRACTICE DEFENSIVE DRIVING</u><br> Defensive driving is an excellent road safety trip that could keep you from a collision.<br>
                        <b> WHAT IS DEFENSIVE DRIVING?</b><br> Effectively, defensive driving is all about being aware of what other drivers on the road are doing and being prepared for the potential of an accident or collision at all times.<br> If another
                        driver is speeding or looks like they are attempting to cut you off, then the defensive driving approach is to extract yourself from the dangerous situation as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>7. KEEP ENOUGH DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE CAR AHEAD OF YOU</u><br> Another of our road safety tips to do with safe driving practices is to make sure that you always have a cushion of space between you and the vehicle in front
                        of you.
                        <br> This is also frequently called the “second rule”.<br> You might have heard of the “three second rule”, which means you should slow and count to three to get enough space behind another driver. This can be enough to give you
                        space and time to react and safely evade hazards on the road.But don’t stop there.<br> You should take into account different vehicles and driving conditions when you’re creating space. For instance, large trucks and other big
                        vehicles with severe blind spots behind them necessitates a four second rule<br> Similarly, you should make it a six second rule when the weather is bad or there are other unsafe driving conditions, like ice on the road. For any
                        condition that might add a little extra risk, you should add a little extra time. </p>
                    <p><u>8. STORE YOUR ITEMS APPROPRIATELY</u><br> If you’re on a long drive or a road trip, then you’re likely to be bringing a significant amount of cargo with you. The majority of it might be safely locked in the trunk, but you should
                        consider items that are aren’t as well. For instance, if there is any cargo that might be at risk of moving around while you’re driving, then you should take whatever measures are necessary to secure them and keep them in place.
                        <br> If something falls to the floor while you’re driving, don’t reach down to try and grab them. This can easily lead to you being caught off guard should a risky situation suddenly arise.<br> Lastly, make sure that any necessary
                        items, such as your ID, are kept in close reach. It’s a good idea to have someone else in the front passenger seat who is responsible for finding and using any items that you’re likely to need while driving</p>
                    <p><u>9. PLAN YOUR ROUTE AND REST STOPS AHEAD OF TIME</u><br> On longer trips on the road, you should be aware of the risks of long periods of uninterrupted driving. As we mentioned in one of the earlier road safety tips, drowsy driving
                        can be just as dangerous as driving under the influence. <br> It also puts your vehicle under greater pressure, meaning that malfunctions and wear and tear are more likely to rear their ugly heads.<br> It’s important to read up
                        in advance on how frequently you should take breaks when driving long distances. When you’re planning your trip, make sure that you’re also planning times to stop for food, where you’re going to refuel the car, stops for any calls
                        you might need to make, and even just general stops to rest.<br> When you’re choosing a route ahead of time, take note of the different rest stops and fuel stations along the way. As such, if you need to make an unplanned stop,
                        you can at least be aware of where the nearest one is.</p>
                    <P><u>10. DON’T USE YOUR PHONE, NOT EVEN ON HANDS-FREE</u><br> Some figures suggest that texting and driving can increase your likelihood of getting into a fatal accident by almost 900%. <br> If that isn’t the clearest possible indication
                        for avoiding using your phone while driving, then perhaps nothing may be able to convince you of the importance of this road safety tip.
