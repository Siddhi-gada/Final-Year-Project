                    <p class="para">Whether for travelling and exploring or work purposes, there may be times when you have to get behind the wheel while in a foreign country. This is where having an international driving license becomes necessary. The international driving license is an official translation for your driver's license issued in your home country, which lets you drive legally in a foreign country. -<br><br><br><br></p> 
                        <div class="header-2">
                            What is an International Driving License (IDL)?
                        </div>
                        <p class="para-2">The International Driving License, officially known as the International Driving Permit (IDP), is a document authorized by the United Nations and issued to people travelling to foreign countries. It certifies that the holder legally possesses a valid driving license in his/her home country. It also translates the document into various foreign languages, so it is easier for foreign officials to verify and understand the credentials. It allows you to legally drive the types of vehicles that are listed in your IDP in foreign nations. The International Driving License contains the name, photo, and driver information, and is a valid form of identification in more than 150 countries, along with your original country's valid driver's license and a valid passport.</p>

                        <p class="para-2">Thanks to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, applying for an International Driving Permit is now a very convenient process. Any individual who wishes to rent and drive vehicles in another country on an overseas trip is required to apply for an International Driving Permit.
                            The steps involved in this process are: -<br>
                            1. Individuals should visit their nearest RTO with the required documents and the application fee.<br>
                            2. You can either fill the application form in person at the RTO or fill it online, at the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways portal (parivahan.gov.in) and carry the acknowledgement with you, along with the other necessary documents to the RTO.<br>
                            3. Submit the documents and pay the prescribed fees. The application and the required documents have to be submitted in person to the concerned RTO by the applicant in both cases.<br>
                            4. The processing time to get an International Driving License after the submission of documents is usually 3-4 business days.</p>
