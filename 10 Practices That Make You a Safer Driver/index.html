                    <p class="para">Although the 2020 lockdown resulted in a 49..47% fall in the number of lives lost in road accidents (April - June, as compared to numbers from 2019), the fact remains that there's still a lot of effort required. To make that happen, one must become a responsible driver and inculcate driving practices that help maintain safety for one and all on the road.<br><br>

                        Driving is an art that needs to be mastered with focus and discipline. Whether you are a new driver who wants to learn how to drive a car or among the experienced drivers who want to brush up their skills, choosing a professional driving school is always a good idea.<br><br>
                        
                        Helping you master safe and responsible driving, Maruti Suzuki Driving Schools are equipped with the best-in-class facilities, expert trainers, a well-balanced curriculum, and much more, which makes the learning experience even more amazing.<br><br>
                        
                        Let's get to the tips that can help you become a safer driver: -<br><br><br><br></p> 
                        <div class="header-2">
                            Join an Advance Driving Course
                        </div>
                        <p class="para-2">Confidence is everything when it comes to driving. The more confident you are, the better control you will have over your driving. If you already know how to drive but are not that confident when it comes to hitting the roads, you can opt to join an advance driving course. It will help you gain the confidence you need to have to become a good driver.</p>
                        <div class="part-1-b">
                            <div class="header-3">
                                Keep Your Car Well-Maintained
                            </div>
                            <p class="para-3">Ensuring that your car is kept in a good condition is very important. It can help you avoid a number of adverse situations on the move. For example, worn out tires are not only prone to punctures but may even end up exploding, causing a car to swerve uncontrollably. Other good practices include making sure that the oil levels of the car are up to the mark and maintaining proper tire pressure while driving, among others.</p>
                            <div class="part-1-c">
                                <div class="header-4">
                                    Always Use Your Seatbelt    
                                </div>
                                <p class="para-4">No matter how confident you are about your driving, no matter how short the distance that you are travelling, you should always make sure that you put on your seatbelt. Even if your car has airbags, it does not mean that you can forget about your seatbelt.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="part-1-d">
                                <div class="header-5">
                                    Practice Defensive Driving
                                </div>
                                <p class="para-5">You can never control how others drive on the road. They may be inexperienced, ignorant of the rules, having an emergency, or just having a bad day! It is up to you to avoid such situations. Become well-versed in defensive driving and hold your own if faced with something like this.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="header-6">
                                Know about the Rules and Regulations
                            </div>
                            <p class="para-6">This is one of the most important aspects of being a safer driver. You need to know about the rules and regulations that your state/country has in place. That way, you can maintain road safety and help ensure smooth mobility. When you join a professional driving school, your curriculum will cover theory classes as well as practical sessions. So, make sure you pay attention to what is taught in class. It will help you when you get behind the wheel by yourself.</p>
                            <div class="header-6">
                                Always Keep a Check on the Speed Limit
                            </div>
                            <p class="para-6">Driving fast may seem like an exciting experience but safe driving is always the better choice. One of the most crucial things that you need to keep in mind is responsible driving. Never exceed the given speed limit and always ensure to keep an eye on your speedometer. Driving within the speed limit is not only safer for you but also for the other people on the road.</p>
                            <div class="header-6">
                                Don't Weave between Lanes
                            </div>
                            <p class="para-6">Another important thing to keep in mind is that no matter how boring traffic jams may get, you should not weave between lanes. Weaving between the lanes more often than not leads to more chaos in the traffic rather than helping you make your way out of it. Patience is a virtue when it comes to driving in the city.</p>
                            <div class="header-6">
                                Don't Drive if You're Drowsy  
                            </div>
                            <p class="para-6">If you feel sleepy, getting behind the wheel may not be the best idea. Drowsiness can impair your driving abilities, making you a hazard on the road, not only for yourself but for others as well. If you simply have to get somewhere, either get someone else to drive or take a cab.<br><br>

                                The onus to drive safely and responsibly is in your hands and these good practices help ensure that. Imbibe and make them a part of your daily driving routine to set the right example for others on the road.</p>
