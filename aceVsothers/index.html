                With more than 475+ driving schools across the nation and having trained more than a million individuals since the last decade and a half, ACE Driving School has already proven itself to be the leading driver training institute in India. MSDS has embarked on a mission to redefine the road culture in India. However, this is easier said than done. In 2017 alone, close to 1.5 lakh individuals died in road deaths across India. To put this number in perspective, it is equivalent to the entire population of Shillong which is the capital of Meghalaya. Even though India has been a signatory to the Brasilia Declaration and has committed to reducing road fatalities by half, our country hasnâ€™t been able to reduce the number of road accidents. Over-speeding, improper actions of drivers and overtaking are some of the leading reasons for road fatalities. These can be easily avoided by imparting the right type of training.

                    More than 4 000 individuals were killed in 2016 because drivers had either jumped the red light or had jumped lanes. While most other driving schools in the country neglect classroom sessions, our comprehensive course lays as great an emphasis on theory as it does on the practice of handling and maintaining a vehicle and maintaining traffic decorum. The course gives you an in-depth understanding of the vehicle and the best way to maintain it, about traffic laws as well as knowledge about insurance policies and claim settlements.

                    <p class="para2"><br>
                    As soon as they enrol, students are given a joining kit which includes a progress card. The beginners's course is a 21-day course which covers 21 hours comprising 7 hours of theory, 2.5 hours of simulation and 10 hours of practical. These are taught simultaneously which enable students to appreciate the importance of different components. Exams are conducted at the end of the course so that students are clear about the fundamental theory and well-versed with the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Students are also given a handbook which outlines rules and responsibilities for drivers.
